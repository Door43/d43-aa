<usfm>
\v 29 And though men rise up to pursue you to take your life, yet the life of my lord will be bound in the bundle of
life with Yahweh your God; and he will sling out the lives of your enemies, as from the bottom of a sling.

===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **yet the life of my lord will be bound in the bundle of life with Yahweh your God**  - The idea is that Yahweh will protect David.  Other translations use "pouch" and "bag" instead of bundle.   Consider how a kangaroo protects its young in a pouch and see if there is something similar in your language.  See: [[:aa:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]].  See also the UDB translation.
