\q2 when I speak from Zion \add Hill in\add* Jerusalem \f + \ft doublet \f*, my voice will \add resemble the sound of\add* thunder.
\q1 \add When that happens\add*, the pastures where you shepherds \add take care of\add* your sheep will dry up
\q2 and \add the grass\add* on top of Carmel \add Mountain\add* will wither\f + \ft Or: become brown \f*

\q2 when I speak from Mount Zion in Jerusalem, my voice will sound like thunder.
\q1 When that happens, the pastures where you shepherds take care of your sheep will dry up,
\q2 and the grass on top of Mount Carmel will wither
\q2 because I will order the rain not to fall."

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **The words of Amos, ... which he saw**  - He "saw" things not of this physical world, things that only God could show him. Amos never says he is a prophet, often called a seer (one who sees), but because his "words" are about what he "saw," he is claiming to be a prophet here.
    * **Yahweh roars** - like 1) a lion or 2) thunder [[:aa:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]
