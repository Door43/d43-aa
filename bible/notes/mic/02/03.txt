\v 3 Therefore, this is what Yahweh says:
\q1 "I will cause you people to experience disasters,
\q2 and you will not be able to escape \f + \ft metonymy \f* from them.
\q1 You will no longer walk around proudly,
\q2 because when that happens, it will be a time of much trouble for you.
\q1
\v 4 At that time, \add your enemies\add* will make fun of you;
\q2 they will ridicule you by singing this sad song:
\q1 'We are completely ruined;
\q2 Yahweh is taking our land\f + \ft Or: fields \f* from us,
\q1 and he will give it to those who will capture us.'~"
\q1
\v 5 So \add when it is the time for the land to be given back to you\add* people who belong to Yahweh,
\q2 there will be no one \f + \ft metonymy \f* who will be able to cast lots\f + \ft Or: throw marked stones \f* to determine which land belongs to whom.

\v 3 Therefore Yahweh says this:
\q "Look, I am about to bring disaster against this clan,
\q from which you will not remove your necks.
\q You will not walk arrogantly,
\q for it will be an evil time.
\q
\v 4 In that day your enemies will tell a parable against you,
\q and lament with a wailing lamentation.
\q They will sing, 'We are completely ruined;
\q Yahweh changes the territory of my people.
\q How can he remove it from me?
\q He portions out our fields to traitors!'"
\q
\v 5 Therefore, you people will have no one to divide up the territory by lot
\q in the assembly of Yahweh.

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **from which you will not remove your necks**  -  Micah makes use of the neck in this passage because often when people were carried off into slavery, they would be tied together with ropes, connecting one person to the next by the neck. AT: A punishment is coming that is inescapable, you shall be carried off by your necks. 
    * **You will not walk arrogantly**  - Micah reemphasizes the impending doom that approaches. (see:[[:aa:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
    * **lament with a wailing lamentation**  - A possible AT: You shall cry with a loud expression of grief.
    * **bold words**  - explanation
    * **bold words**  - explanation
