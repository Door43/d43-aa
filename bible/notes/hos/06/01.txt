\v 1 The people say, "Come, let us return to Yahweh.
\q1 He has torn our flesh to pieces as a lion tears up his victim.
\q2 He did this, but he will heal our wounds.  
\q1 He has hurt us and made us fall down,
\q2 but he will treat our wounds and bind them up so they will heal.

  * **After two days he will revive us; he will raise us up on the third day **- This symbolizes a short period of time; Israel believed God would quickly come to their aid and deliver them from their enemies. (See: [[:aa:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
  * **Let us know Yahweh **- "Let us experience Yahweh's presence and power in our lives"
  * **His going out is as sure as the dawn** - Yahweh will go to the help of his people just as surely as the sun rises each morning. (See: [[:aa:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
